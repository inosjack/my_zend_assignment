My Assignment
=============

#####Problem Statement : 

`You have to create a post api in zf2(Zend Framework 2) which will accept 2 
params emailId and Name and return success response. But I want to send a 
default email to the entered emailId.`

`The process of sending email should be asynchronous. Asynchronous means that api shouldn't have to wait till 
email is sent. Api should return response as soon as data is saved. To 
make it async you have to use job queue.`


######Task: 
1. Create a post api in zf2 
2. Implement job queue in zf2 to send email.
